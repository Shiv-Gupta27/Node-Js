Start learning the nodejs 

1.What is NodeJS <br>
 1. JavaScript Runtime: Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser.   
 2. NodeJs is a JavaScript in a different environment means Running JS on the server or any computer.  
 3. Built on Chrome's V8 Engine: It runs on the V8 engine, which compiles JavaScript directly to native machine code, enhancing performance.  
 4. V8 is written in C++ for speed.   
 5. V8 + Backend Features = NodeJs.


2.What is NodeJS <br>
 1. Design: Features an event-driven, 
non-blocking I/O model for efficiency.<br>
 2. Full-Stack JavaScript: Allows using 
JavaScript on both server and client 
sides.<br>
 3. Scalability: Ideal for scalable network 
applications due to its architecture. <br>
4. Versatility: Suitable for web, real-time 
chat, and REST API servers.<br>

3. NodeJs Features<br>
 1. Non-blocking I/O: Designed to perform non-blocking operations 
by default, making it suitable for I/O-heavy operations.<br>
 2. Networking Support: Supports TCP/UDP sockets, which are 
crucial for building lower-level network applications that 
browsers can’t handle.<br>

4. NodeJs Features<br>
 1. Window Object: The global window object, which is part of web 
browsers, is absent in Node.js.<br>
 2. DOM Manipulation: Node.js does not have a built-in Document Object 
Model (DOM), as it is not intended to interact with a webpage's 
content.<br>
 3. BOM (Browser Object Model): No direct interaction with things like 
navigator or screen which are part of BOM in browsers.<br>
